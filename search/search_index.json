I got my Bachelor's degree in Physics with an astrophysics concentration in 3 years with honors and distinction in the major from the University of California Santa Barbara. I am currently in the Master's program at McGill University for radio astronomy. </p> <p>I grew up in the Chicago area and decided at a young age that I wanted to do some sort of science, even though at the time I thought I wanted to be a veternarian. It wasn't until high school in the astronomy competition for Science Olympiad that I found I wanted to know everything I could about the universe and I loved looking beyond Earth. </p> <p>During my undergraduate education, I worked as a tutor. This fostered my desire to teach and help other people understand more about our world and beyond. I hope to continue to teach as a TA and hopefully one day as a professor. I also took part in a mentoring program that was the best thing I decided to do while I was there. This is very important to me and I hope to help as many people as I can.</p> <p>As I get further into my career I hope to encourage young girls to pursue science and help communicate cutting edge science to the public. I hope to get involved in programs at McGill and elsewhere as I continue in my academic career. </p>"},{"location":"about/#other-interests","title":"Other Interests","text":"<ul> <li>Favorite Reads</li> <li>Kayaking</li> <li>Equestrian</li> </ul>"},{"location":"about/#cv","title":"CV","text":""},{"location":"about/equestrian/","title":"Equestrian","text":"<p>I started riding horses when I was 8 years old.

While it wasn't exactly a simple start, I have loved it ever since. </p> <p>Since then, every chance I got, I would go kayaking. Unfortunately, until I lived at UCSB, I did not live near a body of water to kayak on, nor did I own one. So I would kayak with my family during vacations and once on the Chicago river (which was dirty and in a 2 person kayak, my mom behind me did not appreciate the splashing). Once at UCSB, there was kayaks available from the school that I used. My now husband bought a kayak in my second year at UCSB that we used on lakes and the ocean. We are hoping to find a place to kayak in Montreal!</p> <p>  Me kayaking in the Santa Barbara Channel</p>"},{"location":"outreach/","title":"Outreach Activities","text":""},{"location":"outreach/#family-science-day-2024-from-planets-to-particles","title":"Family Science Day 2024: From Planets to Particles","text":"<p>In September of 2024 I volunteered for McGill's family science day.
