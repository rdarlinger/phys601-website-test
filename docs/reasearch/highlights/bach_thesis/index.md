# Bachelor's Thesis

In my time at UCSB, being in the honors college allowed me to write and defend a bachelor's thesis. This is the culmination of my undergraduate research in machine learning for an optical transient pipeline. This was a pipeline to identify things that change brightness in the sky (transients) in the optical bands of observing. I used the machine learning framework of [YOLO](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) to test the capabilities of machine learning.
