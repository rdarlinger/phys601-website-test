# Research Interests

During my undergraduate degree I worked on testing a machine learning algorithm for an optical transient pipeline. I am currently working in radio astronomy and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) as part of [Astroflash](https://astroflash-frb.github.io/) and the [CHIME](https://chime-experiment.ca/en) collaboration. 

I hope to continue investigating and implementing machine learning in my research. I am interested in investigating signals that we do not understand the origin of (like FRBs). In general I am interested in transients, cosmology, and machine learning.
