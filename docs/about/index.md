## Introduction

I am a developing astrophysicist, just starting my exploration of the cosmos. I got my Bachelor's degree in Physics with an astrophysics concentration in 3 years with honors and distinction in the major from the University of California Santa Barbara. I am currently in the Master's program at McGill University for radio astronomy. 

I grew up in the Chicago area and decided at a young age that I wanted to do some sort of science, even though at the time I thought I wanted to be a veternarian. It wasn't until high school in the astronomy competition for Science Olympiad that I found I wanted to know everything I could about the universe and I loved looking beyond Earth. 

During my undergraduate education, I worked as a tutor. This fostered my desire to teach and help other people understand more about our world and beyond. I hope to continue to teach as a TA and hopefully one day as a professor. I also took part in a mentoring program that was the best thing I decided to do while I was there. This is very important to me and I hope to help as many people as I can.

As I get further into my career I hope to encourage young girls to pursue science and help communicate cutting edge science to the public. I hope to get involved in programs at McGill and elsewhere as I continue in my academic career.
